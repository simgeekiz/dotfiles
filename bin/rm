# This script is a replacement for the standard `rm` command.
# It prompts the user for confirmation before deleting files or directories.
# It is designed to be used as a safer alternative to the `rm` command.
# Usage: rm [options] <file1> <file2> ...
# Options:
#   -f, --force    Ignore nonexistent files and never prompt    
#   -i, --interactive  Prompt before every removal
#   -r, --recursive  Remove directories and their contents recursively
#
# Usage:  rm [options] <file1> <file2> ...
