## 1. Check for existing SSH keys. 

        #Checking for existing SSH keys  
        ls -al $HOME/.ssh 
        
        if [ -d $SSHDIR ]; then
          if [ -f "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub" ]; then
            echo "$HOME/.ssh/id_rsa.pub exists."
          elif [ -f "$HOME/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub" ]; then
            echo "$HOME/.ssh/id_ecdsa.pub exists."
          elif [ -f "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub" ]; then
            echo "$HOME/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub exists."
          else
            echo "Generating a new SSH key"
            read -p "Please enter the email address you wish to create ssh key? " EMAIL
            ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "$EMAIL"
          fi 
        fi

      #Start the ssh-agent in the background.
      $ eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"

      #Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent.
      ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
